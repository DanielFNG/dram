This directory exists to store the err.log and out.log files, which are created
and updated when performing actions using the OpenSim API. These files are 
accessed for some important functions in the toolbox (e.g. performing mass 
adjustment via RRA), and can be useful for investigating the cause for poor 
results or failed simulations.
