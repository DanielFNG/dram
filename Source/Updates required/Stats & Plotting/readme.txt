These plotting scripts were implemented for the metric class, which has 
since been upgraded to MetricStats2D. There was no time/need to upgrade
these plotting scripts at the time of the class upgrade, so these will 
need to be adjusted to suit the needs of the new class when/if they are 
required again.
